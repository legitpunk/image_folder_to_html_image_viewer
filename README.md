# image_folder_to_html_image_viewer
Assign a folder and it'll display the images and folders in that folder as html pages that can be navigated.
User must create an apache alias to use with this system.
Works with windows, as haven't yet added linux support.
Just needs a folder with image files.
Made this code because some of the code is part of a platform being developed and we needed testing.
